## Overview

There are three kinds of teaching by the Catholic Church:

- Divinely revealed truths, which are truths derived from the Bible, and Immaculate Conception and Assumption of Mary.
- Faith and morals, such as transubstantiation, sacramental seal, no woman priests, and papal infallibility itself.
- Discipline, such as priest celibacy, fasting and abstinence.

Among which, **divinely revealed truths and teachings on faith and morals are infallible**.

The doctrine of infallibility does not stop at the pope, but also extends to the ecumenical councils and the bishops. However, bishops cannot declare doctrines on their own, rather, only when they speak of the doctrines declared by the Catholic Church then their words can be taken to be infallible.

One question that one might have is,

<box type="wrong">

Wasn't the teaching of infallibility only defined in 1870, which has no apostolic backing?

</box>

At first, this seems like the teaching of infallibility has no basis, and is a circular argument. However, 1870 is when only the term of infallible teaching was defined - **ex cathedra**. The teachings of the Church has been being held infallible since the start of Church, not only since ex cathedra was defined. It is only when the papal infallibility was called into question that the doctrine was defined.

From the definition of papal infallibility, we can see that the pope is not infallible in many aspects. In fact, errors made by the pope in other areas does not compromise his infallibility in teachings of divinely revealed truths and faith and morals.

### Pope's personal life

Popes are by no means perfect in their personal lives. We see that even Peter was not perfect in his life, while his teachings can still be held infallible.

#### Pope Stephen VI

Formosus was a bishop in Porto-Santa Rufina (a region in Italy), and was sent as a legate in Bulgaria. He was so successful that Bulgarian ruler Boris I asked the then-pope to appoint Formosus as the bishop of Bulgaria. The request was not accepted as that would violate fifteenth canon of the Second Council of Nicaea, canon 15. [[ref]](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3819.htm)

Afterwards, the new pope John VIII excommunicated with Formosus, accusing him of corrupting the minds of Bulgarians that they would not accept any other bishop. According to rumours, Formosus begged for forgiveness, in exchange he would forgo his bishop office and live as a layman. Formosus then became the next pope.

Formosus supported (Carolingian) Arnulf, who invaded Rome. Formosus crowned him to oppose Lambert. Lambert re-entered Rome afterwards, and forced the next pope Stephen VI to conduct the trial of ex-pope Formosus.

In the Cadaver synod, Stephen VI exhumed and tried Pope Formosus' corpse, his predecessor. Stephen VI accused him of perjury, and the corpse of pope Formosus could not respond to his questioning. Pope Stephen VI then displayed his corpse through Rome and finally dumped the corpse in Tiber River. [[ref]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver_Synod)

#### Pope John XII

He led a "depraved" and "worldly" life, where his Lateran Palace was described as a brothel.

He was also a prince of Rome. His enemies used this to blacken his reputation.

In Synod of Rome 963 [[ref]](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08426b.htm), John XII was accused of sacrilege, simony, perjury, murder, adultery, and incest, and was summoned in writing to defend himself.

According to rumours, John died during an act of adultery.

He also made an oath with Otto I that he will only support him, not Adalbert. Out of fear for Otto I, John conspired against him and supported Adalbert.

#### Pope Benedict IX

Pope Benedict IX was the only pope known for selling the papacy. Benedict offered his godfather, John Gratian, if John would reimburse Benedict with his election expenses. The deal went through, and John was eventually elected as pope, Gregory VI.

He then even attempted to reclaim the papal office twice. [[ref]](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02429a.htm)

#### Alexander VI

Alexander VI was father of several children by his mistresses. Some were even officially recognised: Juan, Cesare, Jofr√©, and Lucrezia [[ref]](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alexander-VI)

He also engaged in nepotism:

- Teenage son Cesare was made a cardinal
- Juan was made duke of Gandia (Spain)

#### My response

Popes are only guaranteed to be infallible in their teachings not their life. In fact, Peter denied Jesus 3 times when Jesus was tried. Though Peter believed in the salvation for the Gentiles, he did not fully practice what he said, as we will see in Paul's confrontation with Peter. More details are included in the section on [Peter](#peter). Such Peter's actions do not undermine his authority to teach definitively, and similar to the current pope and the magisterium.

### Pope's personal opinion

Pope's teachings are considered infallible only when he invokes the power of the Church, not in his personal letters or personal words. There are many incidents where the pope talked of the wrong teaching. However, in such cases, the pope never invoked the authority of the chair of Peter.

#### Pope Honorius I

Pope Honorius I was condemned for not condemning monothelitism, which says that Jesus only has one will (one nature) - i.e. only divine will, not human will. [[ref]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Honorius_I)

Sergius was the Patriarch (Bishop) of Constantinople. Sergius wrote a letter to pope Honorius I, asking for his opinion on monothelitism. In his letter to Sergius, pope Honorius replied:

- He praised Sergius for dropping the term "one nature".
- He advised him not to speak of the term "two nature", as this can be confused with Nestorian, which says Jesus was two distinct persons: one divine and one human.

Pope Honorius' reply was not a declaration of faith or dogma, and did not claim to speak with the papal authority.

Sergius went further to tell people to confess one will in Jesus, and avoid the terms, declaring it "truly agreeing with the Apostolic preaching." By which time, Honorius was already dead.

Pope St Agatho then later used the authority as successor of Peter, and the Third council of Constantinople, to condemn monothelitism, and declared two natures. In the same letter, pope Honorius I was anathematized (excommunicated). [[ref]](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07452b.htm)

#### Pope Zozimus

Bishops in Africa condemned Pelagius for his heresies, so he sent his profession of faith, first time by a servant, second time in a letter, to pope Zozimus. Pope Zozimus did not find anything wrong with the profession, and so instructed those bishops in Africa against Pelagius to appear in Rome for further investigation.

However, in reality, Pelagius,

- denied the original sin, and
- taught that God's grace was not necessary for good works, and hence God's grace was not necessary for salvation.

What Pelagius exactly included in his exchange with pope Zozimus could not be verified.

Pope Zozimus' actions outraged the bishops in Africa, as they considered the controversy to have been closed by the previous pope Innocent I. Zozimus then backed down, explaining that he had not settled the matter definitively, and wished to consult the African bishops further on the matter. The bishops provided Zozimus with additional evidence against Pelagius, after which the pope condemned Pelagius.

#### My response

In both of the cases above, we see that the pope only made errors in his personal actions or letters. However, the pope, and the magisterium in general, did not make doctrinal errors when speaking with the authority of the Church. Pope's personal opinions in no way undermine the authority of the papal office.

### Judgement on science

The church is not responsible for teaching science. And contrary to popular belief, the Catholic Church as a whole does not assert any scientific statement.

#### Geocentrism vs Heliocentrism

The church previously approved of the idea of geocentrism, i.e. the Earth is the center of the universe, and the Sun rotates around the Earth. This in part is due to the literal interpretation of the Bible. In fact, many verses in the Bible, if taken literally, suggests that the Earth should be the center of rotation, and should not move around another object.

<box type="info">

**Joshua 10:13**

"Sun, stand thou still at Gibeon,<br>
and thou Moon in the valley of Ai'jalon."<br>
And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed,<br>
until the nation took vengeance on their enemies.

Is this not written in the Book of Jashar? The sun stayed in the midst of heaven, and did not hasten to go down for about a whole day.

**Psalms 93:2**

Yea, the world is established; it shall never be moved;<br>
thy throne is established from of old;<br>
thou art from everlasting.

**Psalms 104:5**

Thou didst set the earth on its foundations,<br>
so that it should never be shaken.

**Ecclesiastes 1:5**

The sun rises and the sun goes down,<br>
and hastens to the place where it rises.

</box>

However, the more compelling reason was because, the church simply reiterates what Ptolemy and Aristotle had asserted in the past. The Catholic Church never asserted that only geocentrism was correct.

Copernicus first proposed the idea of heliocentrism, i.e. the Sun is the centre of the universe, and the Earth rotated around the Sun. It was then verified by Galileo's experiments with his new telescope.

For the record, Martin Luther was even more against the theory than the Catholic Church, which was the reason why Galileo shared his findings with the Catholic Church rather than the Protestant church. [[ref]](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1031319-there-is-talk-of-a-new-astrologer-nicolaus-copernicus-who) . "However, as Holy Scripture tells us, so did Joshua bid the sun to stand still and not the earth." [[ref]](https://learn.ligonier.org/articles/luther-calvin-and-copernicus-reformed-approach-science-and-scripture)

Cardinal Robert Bellarmine, a Jesuit, fearing the opposition from traditional scientists, who believed in geocentrism, forbade Galileo from defending heliocentrism, but did not forbid him from conjecturing it. [[ref]](https://www.famous-trials.com/galileotrial/1018-keyfigures)

Pope Urban VIII was interested in Galileo's theory. He gave his viewpoint to Galileo, that God could do anything, regardless of the laws of Physics. Galileo then quoted the pope on this to criticise the pope, saying that the pope used the Lord as explanation to everything because of his ignorance. The pope then ordered the arrest of Galileo. [[ref]](https://www.catholic.com/tract/the-galileo-controversy)

#### Flat Earth theory

Have you heard of the following ideas: in the Medieval time, many seafarers did not make it back, because, the Catholic Church asserted, that they fell off the edges of the Earth?

Perhaps you have not. But I have heard this many times when I studied history in Vietnam.

However, this is a total myth. For a very long time, the Catholic Church actually held onto the belief that the Earth is spherical. [[ref]](https://www.catholic.com/qa/is-flat-earth-belief-biblical) [[ref]](https://www.ewtn.com/catholicism/library/catholic-church-and-galileo-2643) In fact, many scientists in the past have held on to the belief that the Earth was round, not just the Catholic Church. It was only in the 19th century that the Fundamentalist movement raise the idea of the flat Earth, claiming that it is suggested in the Bible, with the phrase "four corners of the earth."

The myth also came from many writings that exaggerated Medieval ignorance of the round Earth, to highlight the conflict between science and religion, particularly writings by [Christopher Columbus, A History of the Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_History_of_the_Life_and_Voyages_of_Christopher_Columbus), and [John William Draper, History of the Conflict between Religion and Science](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1185/1185-h/1185-h.htm). But this myth is in no way true.

#### My response

We see that the Catholic Church never actually made an infallible teachings on the topics of science. The Catholic Church was never in a position to declare which scientific statements should be correct and which should not.

In the case of geocentrism vs heliocentrism, the Catholic Church was involved in the controversy only because it could face the truth better than the Protestant church. In the case of flat Earth theory, it was a total myth, as the Catholic Church never subscribed to the idea.

## The apostles

Jesus has given the apostles the authority to teach infallibly.

<box type="tip">

**Matthew 18:17-18**

If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. Truly, I say to you, ==whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven==.

</box>

That is, whatever the apostles declare on Earth, God will ratify in heaven. It is not that God is bound by whatever the apostles say, but it is that the apostles are free from error in their teachings about God.

Similarly, in the last supper, Jesus has restated their gift of teaching infallibly,

<box type="tip">

**Luke 22:28-30**

You are those who have continued with me in my trials; as my Father appointed a kingdom for me, ==so do I appoint for you== that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

</box>

At the very beginning of the Catholic Church, the power to teach authoritatively does not stop at the head of the church, but also applies to the apostles.

## Peter

So then, what is so special about Peter, if he is just one of the apostles who can teach infallibly? Well, the pope is the foundation of the Catholic Church, the sign of unity of the Church. Peter himself was the first pope.

Jesus has singled out Peter, and declared him the foundation of the Church.

<box type="tip">

**Matthew 16:18-19**

And I tell you, you are Peter, and on ==this rock== I will build my church, and the powers of death shall not prevail against it. I will give you the ==keys of the kingdom of heaven==, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.

</box>

Notice that Peter was similarly given the power to teach authoritatively, which was also given to the apostles later on. However, we have to notice, the key difference here is that, Peter was declared to be the "rock" and hold the "keys of the kingdom of heaven."

- The rock is the foundation of the church, which indicates Peter's special role in the church.
- Holding the key of the kingdom of heaven is the sign that Jesus trusted Peter to operate the Catholic Church when Jesus is gone. Similar to when the owner is not at home and gives the keys to the servant to act on his behalf, Peter is given this authority to act as the vicar of Christ.

This power is special, in reality, it is to decide whether a council is ecumenical. Peter holds a special position to ensure that the Catholic Church does not sway away from the truth. In fact, Jesus once again singled out Peter in the upper room during the last supper,

<box type="tip">

**Luke 22:31-32**

Simon, Simon, behold, Satan demanded to have you, that he might sift you like wheat, but I have prayed for you that ==your faith may not fail==; and when you have turned again, ==strengthen your brethren==.

</box>

Sifting like wheat suggesting that Peter will go through trials, and under the hands of Satan, Peter would be helpless. But his faith would never fail, suggesting that his teachings on faith topics will be free from error. And Peter is the one to "strengthen your brethen", suggesting that Peter holds the ultimate authority to determine what is right and what is wrong, regardingly the matter of church teachings.

In fact, Peter was given the authority as the leader of the church even when he was not perfect. Even when Peter expressed so to Jesus. We see that when Jesus appeared to the apostles, Jesus again singled out Peter and instructed him to "feed my lambs,"

<box type="tip">

**John 21:15-17**

When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon, son of John, do you **love me more than these**?" He said to him, "Yes, Lord; you know that !!I love you!!." He said to him, "Feed my lambs." A second time he said to him, "Simon, son of John, **do you love me**?" He said to him, "Yes, Lord; you know that !!I love you!!." He said to him, "Tend my sheep." He said to him the third time, "Simon, son of John, !!do you love me!!?" Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, "Do you love me?" And he said to him, "Lord, you know everything; you know that !!I love you!!." Jesus said to him, "Feed my sheep."

</box>

Notice that in Greek, the "love" words in bold are _agape_, meaning unconditional, selfless love, while the "love" words with underline are _phileo_, meaning the love of friendship. Jesus wanted Peter to love him uncondtionally, selflessly. But Peter was not ready, and instead answered with a love of friendship.

And that was alright, Jesus ultimately accepted the _phileo_ love that Peter at that time offered. But Jesus hinted Peter that, ultimately, Peter would achieve _agape_ love for Jesus.

<box type="tip">

**John 21:18**

Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you girded yourself and walked where you would; but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go.

</box>

This was hinting at the fact that Peter would die in the name of Jesus, which was an ultimate sign of agape love.

Popes are not necessarily the most virtuous people, who lead perfect lives. As we see in the case of Peter, God accepted an imperfect person to lead his flock.
